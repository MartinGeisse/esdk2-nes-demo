# Day 1

Created a project and repository. Added ESDK2 and LWJGL dependencies. 

The simulator GUI window opens, but drawing a test pixel doesn't work yet.

# Day 2

Added cartridge file loader; stub for sequential CPU model; temporary WIP versions of NES and 6502 docs.

Made the test pixel work. The problem was the inverted Y axis in OpenGL screen coordinates.
