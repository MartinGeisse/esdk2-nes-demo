little endian

overflow flag: "signed carry"

borrow ::= !carry

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Flags:

7 N = negative
6 V = overflow
5 _ = _
4 B = break command
3 D = decimal mode
2 I = interrupt disable
1 Z = zero
0 C = carry (9th bit in shift)

Carry: affected by ADC, ASL, CLC, CMP, CPX, CPY, LSR, PLP, ROL, RTI, SBC, SEC
Zero: affected by ADC, AND, ASL, BIT, CMP, CPY, CPX, DEC, DEX, DEY, EOR, INC, INX, INY,
	LDA, LDX, LDY, LSR, ORA, PLA, PLP, ROL, RTI, SBC, TAX, TAY, TXA, TYA
Interrupt Disable: set by reset and interrupt. Reset by CLI, PLP;
	return from interrupt with previosly reset. Set by SEI and cleared by CLI.
	Afected by BRK, CLI, PLP, RTI, SEI.
Break Command: Set by BRK; used in interrupt service routine to detect that
unused (_) -> reads 1
(signed) Overflow: 0. Assigned by ADC and SBC. Set to the value of bit 6 by
	the BIT instruction. Affected by ADC, BIT, CLV, PLP, RTI, SBC.
	6502: A cpu pin can be used to set the overflow flag. Seems like this pin is not
	present in the NES.
	Overflow logic (add): adding opposite sign never overflows. Adding same sign
	must produce a result with the same sign, otherwise there is an overflow.
Negative: Assign to bit 7 of the result in:
	ADC, AND, ASL, BIT, CMP, CPY, CPX, DEC, DEX, DEY, EOR, INC, INX, INY,
	LDA, LDX, LDY, LSR, ORA, PLA, PLP, ROL, BIT, SBC, TAX, TAY,
	TSX, TXA, TYA

LDA:
M -> A
ignore carry, overflow (important for multi-byte add!)
assign zero, negative

STA:
A -> M
ignore all flags

ADC:
A + M + C -> A
assign carry
set overflow to (whether sign changed)
assign negative
assign zero

SBC:
A - M - !C -> A
assign carry = (result >= 0)
assign overflow to (result outside -127..127)
assign negative
assign zero

AND: A & M -> A; assign zero, negative
ORA: A | M -> A; assign zero, negative
EOR: A ^ M -> A; assign zero, negative

SEC: set carry
CLC: clear carry

SEI: set interrupt disable
CLI: clear interrupt disable

SED: set decimal mode
CLD: clear decimal mode

CLV: clear overflow flag
